User Story:
User uploads an image via web browser (target: android chrome), which then displays or downloads (preferred) a resized image for printing.

- assume image is already finalized (e.g. w/ snapseed) and has proper aspect ratio (4:3).
- resulting image is converted to 640x480, 254 dpi.
- stretch: apply printing profile: -~1/2ev, increase saturation, increase contrast, white balance/color correction
- test: printed image is visually similar to LCD display (phone, camera, etc.)


Prototype:
phase 1: bash script to do conversion

web-based listener- go, node.js
docker container
